<h3>Paragraph</h3>

<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing
to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or
conversations?"</p>

<p>So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very
sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by
her.</p>

<hr />

<p>Use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for line breaks.</p>
<p>All in the golden afternoon<br />
Full leisurely we glide;<br />
For both our oars, with little skill,<br />
By little arms are plied,<br />
While little hands make vain pretence<br />
Our wanderings to guide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his
  work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure:
  "I've found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube
  in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else."
  Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.</p>
  <p><cite>A Study in Scarlet</cite> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
